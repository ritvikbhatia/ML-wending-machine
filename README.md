# ML-wending-machine


# Basic Objective:- 
To reduce the queue and the time spent by the patients in government hospitals in taking medicines as per prescription .The vending machine designed will take the prescription and will provide the medicines as written.

# Expected objective:-
As to make a proper medicine vending machine we will be requiring a very large data set and knowledge of medicines we will be working on 6-7 medicines and will be implementing the idea. Later with the help of proper knowledge and data set we can implement it at a large scale.

# Background of work:-
The medicine written on the prescription paper will be read with the help of machine learning and compared with the existing data set . The data read will be encoded into binary form which will be given to Raspberry Pi which will accordingly turn the servomotor and the required amount of medicine will come out.


The Hospitals generates a huge amount of information about a patient in the form of medical notes and prescriptions which are handwritten.
The hospital currently digitizes and stores them in pdf format.
Prescription analyser software uses open cv technology and scans and read all the information written on the paper 
These days in government hospitals there is a very long queue infront of chemists to give the prescribed medicines. Using this software we can design a machine which can read the prescription and give the medicines accordingly.
This will reduce a lot of toxity that is ongoing in government hospitals as follows:-
1.	Corruption .
2.	Long queue.
3.	Wrong prescription due to human error.
We have created a software using machine learning algorithm, it will detect the name of the medicine written on the prescription by the Doctor. Followings are the basic steps:
1.	Data written on a paper will be read by the machine.
2.	Machine will then decide what is written on the prescription paper by comparing it with the pre-existing data set. This has been accomplished with the help of machine learning algorithm .
3.	According to decided data, pre decided action will take place.
